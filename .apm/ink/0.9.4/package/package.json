Although Ink is in an early state, people interested in\r\ngetting it running with other languages are welcome to reach out.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/full.gif\" /></div>\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n\r\n*(These demos show off Ink as part of [Julia](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client)\r\nsince it's the most mature project using Ink, but there's nothing Julia-specific about\r\nInk's design)*\r\n\r\nEvaluation of blocks and lines, with inline results, highlighting of the evaluated block,\r\nand loading indicators:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/eval.gif\" /></div>\r\n\r\nSmart tree views for complex results and data:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/tree.gif\" /></div>\r\n\r\nA rich console with the same support for results, as well as history, shell modes etc.:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/console.gif\" /></div>\r\n\r\nSmart errors with live links to files in the backtrace, as well as highlighting of those\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/errors.gif\" /></div>\r\n\r\nIn future Ink will also support UIs for debugging (e.g. breakpoints), graphics (e.g. plotting panes), documentation (e.g. single-keystroke access to inline docs) and profiling/coverage results (e.g. inline \"progress bars\" and metrics overlaid with the code).\r\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink#readme","_id":"ink@0.9.4","_shasum":"1db3ce50417e378a0d28472ba8e54c48ba3e55b7","_resolved":"file:../d-118714-33725-8m7vfr.6n3fw53ik9/package.tgz","_from":"../d-118714-33725-8m7vfr.6n3fw53ik9/package.tgz"}
